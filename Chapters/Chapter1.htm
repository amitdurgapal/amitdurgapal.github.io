                            <p>The Bhashya of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada is the means for
understanding the meaning of the sutras. The Bhashya begins with the
Adhyasabhashya. We shall first examine what is the purpose of the
Adhyasabhashya and what is the relationship between the first sutra and
Adhyasabhashya. Another matter to be considered is, what are the
objections raised by other schools and what is the reply of Advaita to
them.
</p>
                            <p>The first sutra is—<i>atha atah Brahmajijnaasaa</i>.</p>
                            <p>
The meaning of the word ‘atha’ is, ‘after having acquired the four
essential requisites’, namely, discrimination between the eternal and the
ephemeral, an attitude of detachment towards enjoyment of the fruits of
action in this world as well as in higher worlds, perfection of disciplines
such as control of the mind, control of all the senses and organs, etc.,
and intense yearning for liberation-- A person who has acquired these four requisites is the competent
person (adhikari) to take up <i>Brahmajijnaasaa</i>. Jijnaasaa means the
desire to know. Desire and knowledge are not matters in respect of which
there can be an injunction. They have to arise by themselves. The desire
for liberation arises in a person who has acquired the four requisites
mentioned earlier. Then he should do whatever is necessary for the
fulfillment of this desire. A man who is hungry and wants relief from it
should eat. Similarly, this sutra says that one who desires liberation
should engage in Vedanta vichara, just as a man who wants to go to
heaven must perform a yajna. The knowledge of Brahman is the means
for liberation. Liberation is the removal of bondage. By the knowledge of
a particular thing the ignorance about it is removed. When it is said that
knowledge of Brahman removes bondage, it is indicated that bondage is
due to ignorance of Brahman. Bondage cannot be removed by any means
other than knowledge of Brahman. Ignorance and its effects are removed
by knowledge. A real snake can be driven away by some action, but an
illusory snake appearing where there is only a rope can be removed only
by the knowledge of the rope. The first sutra therefore indicates that
bondage is mithya (not real). This conclusion is arrived at by the
pramana known as arthaapatti. Arthaapatti is explained later on.
</p>
                            <p>There are gradations in bondage. The main bondage is the
connection of ignorance with the Atma, in the form of superimposition.
Thereafter comes the superimposition of the subtle and the gross bodies.
Then follows the superimposition of external objects. In superimposition
there is a substratum (adhishthana) and the superimposed (aaropya). Sri

Sankara says that there is a blending of the real and the unreal (satyaanrte
midhuneekrtya). So in bondage one part is real
(Atma), and the other part is unreal (anaatma).
Now an objection is raised. It is said that such a superimposition is
impossible because the requisite conditions for the same are not present.
So the claim in the first sutra that bondage can be removed by
knowledge cannot be correct. The Adhyasabhashya is intended to reply
to this objection.
Now the question arises, what is the need for dealing with
superimposition at the beginning of the Bhashya itself? The answer is
that if the objections raised are answered, then the further study of the
Saastra can proceed.
This work is known as Saarirakamimamsa-means the one who is in the body, i.e. the jiva. So this Saastra
deals with the <i>jiva</i>. But it begins with the desire to know Brahman. This
shows that the subject-matter of this Saastra is the oneness of jiva and
Brahman. But the jiva looks upon himself as different from Brahman. It
follows that this difference is due only to ignorance. Bondage which is
the result of this ignorance is therefore mithya. Thus it seen that two
results flow from this. One is that, since bondage can be removed by
knowledge, it must be mithya. The second is that, since jiva and
Brahman are one, bondage is <i>mithya</i>. The purpose of the
Adhyasabhashya is to establish these two matters.
</p>
                            <p>Now two objections are raised: (1) Just because knowledge removes
bondage, it does not follow that bondage is mithya. (2) Since the Saastra
is pramana, why can it not be merely accepted, and what is the need for
proving that bondage is mithya?
</p>
                            <p>In support of the first objection some examples are given. It is said
that a poison which has entered the body is removed by thinking of
Garuda (Garudasmaranam). The thought of Garuda is only knowledge.
By this knowledge the poison, which is real, is removed. It is said that
detachment can be acquired by knowing the adverse effects of senseobjects.
Here also the knowledge of the adverse effects removes the desire
for the sense-objects, though the desire is real. The sin of killing a
Brahmana is said to be removed by the sight of Setu. The sight of Setu is
only knowledge and it destroys the sin which is real. Another example is
the antecedent negation of knowledge (jnaana-praagabhaava), which is
removed by knowledge, though it is real.
</p>
                            <p>These objections are answered as follows. </p>
                            <p>The mere thought of
Garuda does not remove the poison. It should be accompanied by the
chanting of the relevant mantras and the performance of prescribed
rituals. Detachment is not mere removal of desire. It is the attainment of
a state of mind which is opposed to desire. The sight of Setu by itself
does not remove the sin. The person has to observe celibacy for twelve
years, should publicly announce his guilt and repentance wherever he

goes, and also perform the prescribed rituals. Antecedent negation is not
a positive entity and so this example is not valid. So in all these cases
mere jnaana does not destroy something that is real.
</p>
                            <p>The second objection is that since the Saastra is pramana, there is no
need for proving its correctness by means of other reasons. This
objection is met as follows. For attaining heaven yaga is prescribed. But
the result, heaven will come only much after the performance of the
yaga. If there is to be the relationship of cause and effect between the
yaga and the attainment of heaven, there should be no intervening period
between the conclusion of the yaga and the attainment of heaven. To
solve this difficulty Mimamsakas have postulated a result in the form of
‘apoorva’ which is produced during the performance of the yaga. This
apoorva continues till the life of the person who has performed the yaga
comes to an end and he attains heaven. This <i>apoorva</i> is not mentioned in
the <i>sruti</i>. It is postulated on the basis of the pramana known as
‘arthaapatti’. When there is a conflict between two pramanas, a conclusion
has to be postulated which reconciles the conflict. For example, a person
named Devadatta is known to be alive, but he is not found in his house.
Both these are pramanas and they are in conflict. So it has to be
concluded that he is elsewhere. This reconciles the conflict. This is
arthaapatti. Another example is-- Devadatta does not eat during the day,
but he continues to be fat. Here also there is conflict between two
pramanas. This is resolved by the conclusion that he must be eating at
night. Similarly, the sruti which is pramana, says that yaga is the cause
of heaven. But we see that heaven is not attained immediately on the
completion of the yaga. This is also a pramana. Thus there is conflict
between the two pramanas. To resolve this conflict apoorva has been
postulated by <i>arthaapatti</i>.
</p>
                            <p>Sri Sankara has said repeatedly that the Saastra gives knowledge
alone and cannot modify facts.  The opponent now
asks: In the case of nacre-silver it is true that knowledge of the nacre
alone is necessary for removal of the illusory silver. But has Vedanta
proved that knowledge by itself leads to removal of bondage and that
knowledge does not depend on anything else for this purpose? This
question has been answered later in the Bhashya on Brahmasutra 3.
4.25 and 3.4.26. There it has been said that for knowledge to arise
karma, etc., are necessary, but once knowledge has arisen it does not
need the help of anything else for removing bondage. In Bhagavadgita
also it has been said in chapter 6 that karma is necessary for a person to
become yogaarudha, but thereafter karma is not necessary, but only the
pursuit of knowledge.
</p>
                            <p>Some contend that even without establishing superimposition, the
study of the Saastra can be proceeded with. This is rejected as
untenable.
</p>
                            <p>The following objection is raised: When you say that if bondage is real,
it cannot be removed by knowledge, what is the nature of the reality that
you are speaking of? Is it vyaavahaarika or paaramaarthika?
</p>
                            <p>The answer to this objection is that it is not correct to divide reality into
two categories. Reality is only one. Only mithya can be divided into two
categories, namely vyaavahaarika or empirical and praatibhaasika or
illusory. So the question raised is without any basis.
</p>
                            <p>The next objection is:- You say that there is superimposition of avidya
on the Atma. Is this superimposition on the paramatma or on the
jivatma? The former is impossible, since paramatma is pure
consciousness. To say that there is superimposition of avidya on
paramatma would be like saying that there is darkness in the sun. If you
say that there is superimposition of avidya on the jivatma, that is also
not tenable, because according to you the jivatma is the same as
paramatma. Moreover, jivatma is consciousness with the
superimposition of avidya. How can there be a superimposition of avidya
on such a jivatma?
</p>
                            <p>The Avaitin’s answer to this objection is: This is not a proper question at
all since it goes against the theory of the Naiyayika himself. To take an
example. A man with a stick is called a ‘dandi’. All men in the world can
be divided into two categories—those with a stick and those without a
stick. There is no other category. Who is the person for whom connection
with a stick arose? Clearly not the person without a stick. If you say that
connection with a stick arose for the dandi, it will mean that he was a
dandi even before he had the stick. So the correct answer is that the
connection with the stick arose for a man and not for a dandi or an
adandi. Similarly superimposition of avidya is for the pure
consciousness. Another example can be given. A man sees smoke on a
mountain and infers that there is fire on the mountain. Any fire falls into
one of two categories; mountain fire and non-mountain fire. Does the
person who infers the existence of fire on a mountain after seeing smoke
there infer that it is mountain fire or non-mountain fire? It cannot
obviously be non-mountain fire. If he says that it is mountain fire, what
is the basis for this inference? The inference is based on his experience
that when there is smoke in the kitchen there is fire there. But that is
non-mountain fire. On the basis of this experience how can he infer the
existence of mountain fire? So it could be said that there is the defect of
non-existence in the example (kitchen) of the thing to be proved
(mountain fire). This is answered by saying that what is inferred is just
fire without any qualification such as kitchen fire, mountain fire, etc.
Similarly, what we say is that the superimposition is on consciousness
as such, without any qualification.
</p>
                            <p>By association with avidya, pure consciousness becomes three-fold,
namely, pure consciousness, Isvara and jiva. According to the reflection
theory (pratibimbavada), these are Isvara who is the bimba, jiva who is
the pratibimba, and pure consciousness which pervades both of them.

Superimposition is the effect of avidya. This superimposition is for the
reflection in avidya (namely jiva) and not for the other two. To take an
example: there is a pot with water in it. There is space within the pot,
there is total space and there is the reflection of space (the sky with the
sun or stars, etc) in the water. When the water in the pot moves it is only
the reflection of space that moves and not the other two. So also, it is
only the reflection in avidya that is affected and not the bimba or pure
consciousness.
</p>
                            <p>According to the author of Prakatarthavivarana both Isvara and jiva are
reflections. The distinction is caused by the reflecting medium. The
medium is Maya for Isvara and avidya for the jiva. Maya has an infinite
number of parts and each part is an avidya. This avidya has two powers,
veiling power and projecting power. It is called avidya because it is
destroyed by vidya. He follows the theory of multiple jivas as
distinguished from that of a single jiva. When a person attains Selfknowledge,
the avidya in his mind is destroyed and he becomes pure
consciousness. Isvara is the indwelling Self and the inner controller for
all jivas. Once a person becomes liberated, he no longer experiences
bondage though the world continues to exist, just as a blind man does
not experience the world through the power of vision.
</p>
                            <p>In the sruti statement which says that Maya is destroyed in its entirety
for the liberated person, Maya means avidya
pertaining to that person alone according to Prakatarthakara. When a
particular jiva attains videhamukti, the avidyasamskara in his inner
organ is destroyed. In this way the parts of Maya known as avidya get
destroyed when the persons to whom those avidyas pertain attain
videhamukti. The question arises whether, in this manner, when all jivas
get videhamukti, Maya will cease to exist. According to Prakatarthakara
this cannot happen because the parts of Maya called avidya are infinite
in number and so they can never be exhausted. This view is
contradictory to those of other commentators who hold that a time will
come when all the jivas are liberated and Maya ceases to exist.
</p>
                            <p>The next question is, if Maya is never destroyed, will not the theory of
non-duality of Brahman be contradicted? The answer is no, because
Maya is mithya and Brahman is the only reality. Even according to
Prakatarthakara Maya and avidya are not different because avidya is
only a part of Maya, just as the pot-space is not different from the total
space.
</p>
                            <p>The next objection is: Adhyasa can occur only if the substratum is not
known. Superimposition of silver can take place only if the nacre is not
known. The Atma is known to every one as ‘I’. The difference between the
self and the not-self, namely, body, mind and sense organs, is known to
all because no one says ‘I am the body’. Moreover, only another
substance can be superimposed on a substance. The illusion is in the
form of ‘This is silver’ and not as ‘I am silver’. The seen cannot be
superimposed on the seer, or vice versa. The Atma being the seer,
nothing can be superimposed on it. Moreover, there has to be some
similarity between the substratum and the superimposed object. One
mistakes nacre for silver because they are similar in that they are both
bright. No one mistakes nacre for an elephant. Atma and Anatma are
totally contradictory like light and darkness.</p>
                            <p>For all these reasons superimposition of the self on the not-self or vice
versa is not possible. When a person says “I am a man”, etc, it is only in
a secondary sense (gauna), like saying ‘This boy is a lion’.
</p>
                            <p>Even though, for the reasons stated above there cannot be
superimposition between the self and the not self as such—let
us consider whether superimposition of the qualities of the one on the
other is possible – , like the superimposition of the red colour of
a flower on a crystal. This is also not possible. Even in the case of the
crystal there is dharmi-adhyasa also, because there is superimposition of
the reflection of the flower on the crystal. Dharma-adhyasa is not
possible without dharmi-adhyasa.
</p>
                            <p>Every one is aware of the difference between nacre and silver, still
superimposition of silver on nacre does occur. Though the difference
between ‘man’ and ‘I’ is known, every one says, ‘I am a man’ though no
one says ‘I am the body’. So knowledge of difference does not prevent
superimposition.
</p>
                            <p>According to the Advaita theory of ‘anirvachaniya’ there is 
superimposition of knowledge, and also  superimposition of the
objects. In the superimposition of silver on nacre, one gets the knowledge
‘This silver’. This is jnana-adhyasa. Knowledge is not possible without an
object. So Advaita says that there is actually silver in front. This is
supported by the fact that the person goes forward to grab the silver. In
the same way, the world which is superimposed on the Atma (Brahman)
is accepted as existing, though it has no absolute realty. The first portion
of the first sentence in Adhyasabhashya refers to <i>artha-adhyasa</i>.
</p>
                            <p>It has been established that the reasons given by the opponent for
rejecting superimposition are not valid. Every one looks upon his body as
himself. The body has birth and death and so the self is also thought to
have birth and death. Similarly the qualities of the self are attributed to
the body and so the body is very dear, though this is actually a quality of
the self. This superimposition is a fact experienced by every one and so it

cannot be denied. This identification of the self with the body cannot be
considered to be merely secondary (gauna) on the ground that every one
knows that he is different from the body because no one says “I am the
body”. Though the difference between nacre and silver is known to every
one, still nacre is sometimes mistaken for silver. This is because of lack
of discrimination at the relevant time. It is therefore said in the Bhashya
that because of lack of discrimination between the self and the not-self, there is ignorance and this is the reason for the
wrong identification. Moreover, though “I’ and ‘man’ are different, no man
says “I am not a man”. So there is no realization of the difference
between ‘I’ and ‘man’. The same is the case when one says “I am the
doer”. Thus, though the difference is known, there is lack of
discrimination between the self and the body and this is the reason for
the identification of the two.
</p>
                            <p>The contention of the opponent that both the substratum and the
superimposed entity should be substances (vishaya) is not tenable
because it is well known from everyday experience that the self and the
not-self are looked upon as identical by every one. Such a patent fact
cannot be rejected by mere arguments.
</p>
                            <p><i>Mithyajnana</i> is split up as mithya+ajnana, i.e. ignorance which is
mithya, that is, it cannot be described as either real or unreal. This is the
reason for the wrong identification. By using the word ‘nimitta’ after
mithyajnana in the Bhashya it is pointed out that ignorance is the
material cause (<i>upaadaana kaaranam</i>) of the superimposition. In
Vedantic terminology, the word ‘<i>nimitta</i>’ is used to denote the efficient
cause and the word ‘upaadaana’ denotes the material cause. But in
grammar and also in worldly usage ‘nimitta’ is used to denote material
cause also. In Nyaya several kinds of causes such as samavayi,
asamavayi, nimitta, are mentioned, but in Vedanta only two causes,
nimitta and upaadaana, are accepted. For any effect to be produced a
material cause is necessary. Illusion (bhrama), being an effect, must have
a material cause. In this sentence in the Bhashya there is no other word
to denote the material cause and so the word ‘nimitta’ has been
interpreted by Prakatarthakara as material cause. The word <i>itaretaraavivekena</i>—
meaning, ‘due to non-discrimination between the self and the
not-self’- has been interpreted as denoting the efficient cause.
Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause of the universe,
but it is the material cause only through vivarta or transfiguration and
not parinaama or transformation, <i>Ajnaana</i> is the material cause of the
universe by transformation (<i>parinami-upaadaanakaarana</i>). <i>Ajnaana</i> is a
defect (dosha) and so the word nimitta implies that ajnana is the efficient
cause also.
Can the word mithyajnaana be split up as <i>mithya</i>+<i>jnaana</i> also? The
answer is no, because the word would then mean adhyasa itself, but not
the cause of adhyasa.
8
The question as to whether there is any pramana for ajnaana cannot
arise at all. The question itself means that the questioner has ignorance.
Moreover, when a person wakes up from deep sleep he says that he slept
happily and did not know anything. This clearly shows that there was
ignorance during sleep.
The expression (Sans.) combining the real and the unreal—
brings out the Advaita theory of Anirvachaniyakhyati. There are five well-known theories of khyati or erroneous cognition,
each held by a different darsana. These theories are described briefly
below.
</p>
                            <p>1. Atmakhyati is the theory of one school of Buddhism known as
Yogachara. They deny the existence of external objects and hold that it is
only internal cognitions that are externalized as objects. According to this
theory the illusory object, say, silver, as well as the substratum, nacre,
are both non-existent and are only internal ideas. The error consists in
their being perceived as external objects. Just as the nacre is only a form
of inner consciousness, so is the illusory silver. In the term Atmakhyati
the word ‘Atma’ stands for consciousness which is momentary and which
appears as the external objects. Advaita Vedanta rejects this theory. One
of the grounds for rejection is that if the substratum, nacre, and the
illusory silver are only forms of inner consciousness, then there cannot
be any distinction between valid and erroneous perception.
</p>
                            <p>2. Asatkhyati—Apprehension of a non-existent thing.
</p>
                            <p>This is the theory of the Nihilist school of Buddhism, known as the
Madhyamika school. It says that in illusory perception something nonexistent
is apprehended as existent. Both the substratum, nacre and the
illusory silver are non-existent. This view is rejected by all the Vedic
schools, because there cannot be any cognition of what does not exist.
The son of a barren woman cannot be seen either in reality or in illusion.
</p>
                            <p>3. Akhyati -- Non-apprehension.
</p>
                            <p>This is the theory of the Prabhakara school of Mimamsa. The view held
by this school is that there is no positive error in illusory perception;
instead, there is only lack of discrimination between the object perceived
(nacre) and the object remembered (silver). The nacre is perceived in a
general way as ‘this’ and not as possessing the distinctive feature of
nacreness. Silver, which was seen elsewhere, is recollected, but without
its association with the past time when, and the particular place where,
it was seen. Such recollection is described as “recollection of an object
robbed of its ‘thatness’. In certain other cases, such as ‘the conch is
yellow’, this school explains that two imperfect perceptions arise, one
being the visual perception of a conch as such, its real colour (white)
being missed, and the other being the visual perception of the yellow
colour of the bilious matter which causes jaundice, the relation of the
yellow colour to the bilious substance being missed. Thus in all cases of

erroneous cognition two distinct cognitions—either a perception and a
recollection or two perceptions—arise, but their distinction is missed.</p>
                            <p>
4. Anyatkhyati— Misapprehension.
</p>
                            <p>This is the theory of the Naiyayikas. When nacre is wrongly perceived as
silver, the erroneous cognition that arises takes the form ‘this is silver’.
Here ‘this’ stands for nacre lying in front of the perceiver, and it is first
seen as a white piece and not as nacre, the distinctive feature of nacreness
being missed either through some defect in sight or because of the
particular situation in which the visual perception arises. The visual
perception of nacre as ‘this’ arises in the ordinary way, by contact of the
visual organ with the object in front. The real silver-ness that belongs to
the real silver existing elsewhere is presented in this visual perception as
the attribute of the nacre seen as ‘this’ in a general form; neither the real
silver nor the real silver-ness could be said to be connected with the
sense of sight through normal sense-relation; and without such senserelation
being established between the sense-organ concerned and the
object to be perceived, perception cannot arise. So the Naiyayikas hold
that the real silver and silver-ness come to be connected with the sense
of sight through an extra-normal type of sense-relation. Thus according
to the Naiyayikas, the visual misapprehension of nacre as silver is an
extra-normal variety of visual perception.
</p>
                            <p>5. Anirvachaniyakhyati. This is the theory of the Advaitins. </p>
                            <p>According to
this the silver seen on nacre cannot be categorized as either real or
unreal. The person seeing it thinks that there is real silver before him
and that is why he stretches out his hand to grab the silver. Similarly,
the universe which is an appearance on Brahman is neither real nor
unreal. As in the case of silver, the universe is looked upon by all as real
until Brahman is realized. As a result of this superimposition every one
says ‘I am a man’, etc., and ‘This is mine’. Thus there are two kinds of
adhyasa.
This superimposition is described as <i>Naisargika</i> which means
‘beginningless’. So far the interpretation of Prakatarthakara has been
given. In his view the objections raised are answered by the three
expressions Itaretaraavivekena, Mithyajnananimitta, Naisargika.</p>
                            <p>
Vivarana and Ratnaprabha consider the objection that there can be
superimposition of a particular object such as silver only if the person
has previously seen real silver somewhere. He must have knowledge of
the superimposed object as a reality. This is not possible in the case of
the superimposition of the non-self because the non-self is not real and
so he could not have experienced it as real previously. This objection is
answered by the word ‘naisargika’ which means that the adhyasa is
beginningless and in each adhyasa the experience of a previous adhyasa
is there. Moreover, it is not necessary that he should have knowledge of

the real object. Even a person who has seen a snake only in a picture
can mistake a rope for a snake.
</p>
                            <p>According to Bhamati, the expression ‘itaretara-avivekena’ answers the
objections. The objection considered is that everyone is aware that the
body is different from the self and so superimposition of the body on the
self is not possible. The answer is that though the difference is known,
there is still lack of discrimination between the two to the extent
necessary and so adhyasa is possible.
</p>
                            <p>In the first part of Adhyasabhashya the lakshana or nature of adhyasa
is described. The adhyasas such as that of silver on nacre, etc are not
disputed by any one; only the mutual adhyasa of the self and the not-self
is claimed to be impossible by other darsanas.
The adhyasabhashya has three parts- definition of adhyasa, the
possibility of adhyasa, and the proof for adhyasa. The definition is now
taken up.
The question is asked: “what is this adhaya?” This may
be taken as a question by a disciple eager to know, or as an objection to
the theory of superimposition by an opponent, depending on the tone of
the questioner. Both these meanings are intended here.
</p>
                            <p>The answer is: <i>Smritirupa paratra purvadrstavabhasa</i>.
</p>
                            <p>The first word in the answer, namely, ‘smritirupah’ is by way of answer
to the disciple. The sentence consists of four parts: smritirupah, paratra.
poorvadrshta, and avabhasah. The words paratra (elsewhere) and
avabhasa (appearance) describe adhyasa. The words smritirupah (of the
nature of, or similar to, remembrance) and poorvadrshtah (seen or
experienced previously) describe the cause of adhyasa. If a person or
thing seen previously somewhere is seen again at another time and place
it is recognition (pratyabhijna) and not adhyasa. If a person sees a cow
somewhere and later on sees another cow at a different time and place,
that is also not adhyasa, but it is recognition of the same species. The
word smritirupah shows that it is not the same as remembrance, but is
only similar to remembrance.
</p>
                            <p>Three factors are the cause of adhyasa—some defect, contact between
the eye and the thing in front, and samskara (mental impression of an
object seen previously elsewhere). Remembrance is knowledge arising
from samskara alone. Knowledge is of two kinds, actual experience
(anubhava) and remembrance. The experience may be from direct
perception (pratyaksha) or the indirect means of knowledge such as
inference, comparison, etc. An experience gives rise to a samskara. This
samskara is the cause of remembrance. The point of similarity between
adhyasa and remembrance is that both are produced by samskara. The
difference is that, for adhyasa there should be some defect as one of the
causes, but not for remembrance. Contact of the eye with an object is
necessary for adhyasa, but not for remembrance. For adhyasa of silver

on nacre there should be contact of the eye with the object in front, the
knowledge that there is an object in front, but not the knowledge of the
nacre-ness of the object. If it is pitch dark the object itself will not be
seen and then there can be no adhyasa. So some defect (dosha), because
of which the nacre-ness of the object in front is not known, is necessary
for adhyasa of silver to take place. This definition of adhyasa brings out
both the tatasthalakshana and the svarupalakshana of adhyasa. The
word smrtirupah denotes the tatasthalakshana and the words paratra
avabhasah denote the svarupalakshana. What has been said so far is the
well known definition (lakshsana) of adhyasa.
</p>
                            <p>Prakatartha gives a different commentary. He takes all the four words
together and says all of them together describe the lakshana of adhyasa.
The word purvadrshta-avabhasa by itself can refer to mere remembrance
also and so there is the defect of over-applicability of the definition if this
word alone is used. To avoid this, the word smrtirupah has been added.
This indicates that it is like remembrance but it is not remembrance
itself. If we say only purvadrshta-avabhasah—the appearance of what
was seen before-- it could apply to recognition also. Recognition requires
previous perception of the particular object, together with the samskara
generated by the previous perception. But recognition is not adhyasa. So
the definition has to be supplemented by some word which will exclude
recognition. The word paratra—elsewhere-- has been added for this
purpose. This shows that what is seen in adhyasa is a thing different
from what was seen before. The silver seen is not the same as the real
silver seen elsewhere.
</p>
                            <p>A person sees a cow at a particular time and place. Later on he sees an
animal resembling a cow, but not another cow. This is not adhyasa. To
prevent this being taken as adhyasa the word purvadrshtah has been
introduced. So what is seen in adhyasa must be what was seen earlier
and not something similar to it. When nacre is seen as silver, what is
seen is silver and not some other substance which resembles silver. Thus
the adhyasa is caused by the samskara of the previous perception of
silver. The silver seen in the adhyasa is however mithya and not the real
silver seen earlier. It is different from what was seen earlier, but it is
thought to be the same.
</p>
                            <p>Bhamati’s view: Avabhasa means knowledge which is discarded later on
when found to be wrong.
</p>
                            <p>What has been said above applies equally to jnana-adhyasa
(superimposition of cognition) and to artha-adhyasa (superimposition of
object). In nacre-silver illusion there is the cogniton “This is silver”. This
is jnana-adhyasa. The person says “There is silver here”. That is, he sees
silver as actually existing before him. The object, silver, is thus actually
present according to him. This is artha-adhyasa, i.e. the object, silver,
appears there. The word ‘smritih’ can be split up as ‘smaryate iti smritih’,
in which case it applies to the object and consequently to artha-adhyasa.

It can also be split up as ‘smaranam iti smritih’ in which case it applies
to the cognition of silver and therefore to jnana-adhyasa.
</p>
                            <p>Defect, contact of the eye with the object, and samskara—these three
are the nimitta karana, efficient cause, of adhyasa. Ignorance of the
nacre is the defect.
</p>
                            <p>Thus the lakshana (definition) of adhyasa has been given. The lakshya
(what is intended to be defined) is -- <i>atsmin tadbuddhi</i>- seeing a thing where
it is not.
The purpose of lakshana is to distinguish a particular thing from other
things- itaravyaavrttih’. For example, a person sees a cow before him. He
can know that it is a cow only if he knows the lakshana of a cow. If he
does not know, he will see it only as some animal. The lakshana for the
moon is “That which is most resplendent is the moon”. Only a person
who knows this definition can identify the moon in the sky. This is the
svarupalakshanam. The pramana (valid means of knowledge such as the
eye) is necessary, but it is not sufficient to identify any object. In
addition, knowledge of the definition (lakshana) of the object is also
necessary.
</p>
                            <p>The other darsanas also admit that there is adhyasa. The Sastras are
intended to remove this adhyasa.
</p>
                            <p>The different darsanas give different definitions for adhyasa. These are
known as khyati. Five of these are well known. In the bhashya three of
these are referred to.
</p>
                            <p>The first definition referred to in the bhashya is, <i>Tam kaycit anyatra Anyadharmadhyaas iti vadanti</i></p>
                            <p>“Some say that it consists in the superimposition of the attributes of one
thing on another”. This is the definition according to Atmakhyati of the
Yogachara school of Buddhism as well as according to Anyathakhyati of
the Naiyayikas. The Yogachara school of Buddhism denies the existence
of external objects and holds that it is only internal cognitions that are
externalized as objects. </p>
                            <p>According to this theory the illusory object, say,
silver, as well as the substratum, nacre, are both non-existent and are
only internal ideas. The error consists in their being perceived as external
objects. Just as the nacre is only a form of inner consciousness, so is the
illusory silver. Advaita Vedanta rejects this theory. One of the grounds
for rejection is that if the substratum, nacre, and the illusory silver are
only forms of inner consciousness, then there cannot be any distinction
between valid and erroneous perception.
According to the theory of Anyathakhyati of the Naiyayikas, when
nacre is wrongly perceived as silver, the erroneous cognition that arises
takes the form ‘this is silver’. Here ‘this’ stands for nacre lying in front of
the perceiver, and it is first seen as a white piece and not as nacre, the
distinctive feature of nacre-ness being missed either through some defect
in sight or because of the particular situation in which the visual
perception arises. The visual perception of nacre as ‘this’ arises in the

ordinary way, by contact of the visual organ with the object in front. The
real silver-ness that belongs to the real silver existing elsewhere is
presented in this visual perception as the attribute of the nacre seen as
‘this’ in a general form; neither the real silver nor the real silver-ness
could be said to be connected with the sense of sight through normal
sense-relation; and without such sense-relation being established
between the sense-organ concerned and the object to be perceived,
perception cannot arise. So the Naiyayikas hold that the real silver and
silver-ness come to be connected with the sense of sight through an
extra-normal type of sense-relation. Thus according to the Naiyayikas,
the visual misapprehension of nacre as silver is an extra-normal variety
of visual perception.
</p>
                            <p>The second definition referred to in the Bhashya is
“But others assert that wherever a superimposition on anything occurs,
there is in evidence only a confusion arising from the absence of
discrimination between them”. This is Akhyati which is the theory of the
Prabhakara school of Purvamimamsa. According to this school all
knowledge is valid knowledge. The object of this definition is to protect
the authoritativeness of the Vedas which are apaurusheya. The validity
of any statement depends on the reliability of the person making it. But
the Vedas have no author. So this theory makes the Vedas self-valid
(svatah pramana).
</p>
                            <p>Sri Sankara points out that, in addition to perception and
remembrance there should be another knowledge of the form “This is
silver” and this is illusion (bhrama). So Akhyativada is not valid.
</p>
                            <p>According to the Tattvadipana commentary on Vivarana this definition
is that of the Sankhyas. This is based on the view that Sri Sankara must
have referred to the Sankhya view because he considers the Sankhyas to
be the principal opponents of Advaita.
</p>
                            <p>The third definition is-- “Others say that the superimposition of anything on any other
substratum consists in attributing some contradictory qualities to that
very substratum”. This is the theory of Asatkhyati held by the
Madhyamika school of Buddhism. It says that in illusory perception
something non-existent is apprehended as existent. Both the
substratum, nacre and the illusory silver are non-existent. This view is
rejected by all the Vedic schools, because there cannot be any cognition
of what does not exist.
</p>
                            <p>However, according to Brahmavidyabharana this is the definition of
Advaita itself.
</p>
                            <p>After referring to these three definitions, Sri Sankara points out that
according to all schools.
There is no difference of opinion on the point that in adhyasa one thing
appears as something else”. Thus this is a feature of adhyasa which is
accepted by all. Such a definition is therefore comprehensive and cannot
be disputed by any one.
All schools of philosophy accept adhyasa. The difference is only in the
method of explaining how it happens. There are five main theories in this
respect, as described in the earlier lectures. The theory of Advaita
Vedanta is Anirvachaniyakhyati. In the bhashya two examples of
adhyasa are taken.
A piece of nacre appears as silver, and one moon appears as many. The
nacre appearing as silver is called ‘nirupaadhika- adhyasa’, i.e.
superimposition without an upadhi or limiting adjunct. This is the kind
of adhyasa because of which one says. “I am a man”. In this adhyasa the
self is identified with the human body. The moon appearing as many due
to reflections in many pots of water is called ‘sopaadhika-adhyasa’—
superimposition with a limiting adjunct. Here the limiting adjunct is the
medium of reflection, namely the pot of water. This is the kind of
adhyasa by which the one non-dual pure consciousness appears as
innumerable jivas, because of being reflected in innumerable subtle
bodies. Adhyasa creates differences such as Isvara and jivas in the one
and only pure consciousness. The suffix ‘vat’ added to ‘rajata’ in the
bhashya indicates that the silver is anirvachaniya, i.e. it cannot be
categorized as either real or unreal. This indescribability has necessarily
to be accepted. Appayya Dikshita gives an example in his work
‘Parimala’. We see a man coming towards us from a distance. We say,
“This man looks like Devadatta”. Here the word ‘like’ does not indicate
similarity, but doubt as to whether the man is Devadatta or not. In
‘rajatavat’ also, the suffix ‘vat’ added to ‘rajata’ does not mean that what
is seen is ‘like silver’. It indicates the indescribability of the silver seen.
By the use of this suffix ‘vat’ Sri Sankara rejects all the other theories
about adhyasa.
</p>
                            <p>Is the silver real or false? If it is real, is the silver actually present in
front, or is it silver existing somewhere else? We cannot say that the
silver is present here because when we go near and examine we find that
there is no silver. If it is silver existing somewhere else (as held by the
theory of Anyathakhyati), it cannot be seen because there is no contact
between the eye and the silver. If the opponent says that it can be seen
even without eye-contact it will mean that anything anywhere can be
seen by us, which is absurd. If the opponent says that the silver is seen
due to some defect (and not by the eye), it will mean that it can be seen
even when the eyes are closed. If the opponent says that the eyes have to
be kept open to see the nacre, and if by keeping the eyes open one can
see even an object far away, then it is not a defect but a blessing. Defect
is what prevents the thing on which it operates from performing its
function. If there is some defect in the eyes, nothing will be seen. The
defect cannot make him see what cannot be seen with good eyes. So
silver which is elsewhere cannot be seen.
</p>
                            <p>Seeing double is not due to a defect. What the defect does is to prevent
the person from seeing that there is only one object. The reason for
seeing double is ajnana or ignorance according to Advaita. So it is
anirvaachya. Defect is the reason for not seeing the moon as only one,
and ajnana is the reason for seeing the moon as two. Because of defect
the nacre is not seen as nacre, and because of ignorance it is seen as
silver. The defect may be in the object, or the person seeing it, or in the
conditions prevailing at the time. The Nihilist Buddhist says that the
objects seen are non-existent. This cannot be, because what is nonexistent
cannot become an object of perception. So the silver is neither
real nor unreal.
</p>
                            <p>Now an objection is raised: how can a thing be both real and unreal,
or different from real as well as different from unreal? The answer is
given by taking an example. An animal cannot be both a cow and a
buffalo. But it can be different from both cow and buffalo. It can be a
horse. Similarly, a thing can be different from both real and unreal.
</p>
                            <p>Vivarana says there is no scope for any such question because the
silver is anirvachaniyam.
Another objection is: The man who thinks it is silver goes forward to
grab it. That means that he thinks it is real silver. So it cannot be
anirvachaniyam. It must be real silver, existing elsewhere. Or, he may
not know that it is anirvaachyam and may think it is real silver. That is
why he tries to grab it.
</p>
                            <p>The answer to this is: The desire to grab the silver arises because he
sees it as real silver. He need not know for certain that it is real silver.
Otherwise even if the silver is real he will not proceed to take hold of it
because he cannot be sure beforehand that it is real. He will be able to
know whether it is real or not only if he goes forward and takes it in his
hand and examines it. If the opponent says that he will proceed to take
the silver only after knowing definitely that it is real, there will be the
defect of mutual dependence (anyonya-aasrayatvam) because only after
he knows that it is real he will try to take it and only after taking it he
will know for certain whether it is real or not. So we must say that the
knowledge that it is silver is sufficient to make him proceed to take it,
and knowledge that it is real silver is not necessary. So merely because
he desires it and attempts to take hold of it, it cannot be said that he has
known it as real silver. But if he already knows that it is false, he will not
make any attempt to take it. From all this it follows that the silver cannot
be described as either real or unreal (anirvachaniyam).
The next objection is: The knowledge of any object comes only through
a pramana. So when silver is seen in an illusion it is wrong to conclude
that there is silver in front. But you, Advaitin, assert that there is silver
by merely seeing silver in an illusion. What is the pramana for this
assertion?
</p>
                            <p>The answer to this is: A cognition cannot arise unless there is an
object. (Only the Vijnaanavaadi school of Buddhism says that there are
no external objects and that only an inner idea appears as an external
object). The silver alone is sublated subsequently and not the cognition of
silver. The cognition is therefore real and so there must be an object for
this cognition. This object cannot therefore be called non-existent. Nor
can we call it real because it is sublated subsequently. So it is
anirvaachyam.
</p>
                            <p>Next objection: You (Advaitin) say that the universe is mithya. So how
can there be the distinction of correct knowledge and illusion in the
world?
</p>
                            <p>The answer is: The silver seen in an illusion is sublated later, but the
real silver is not sublated during the whole lifetime of the person. Though
the silver seen in an illusion and the real silver are both mithya, there is
a difference in the manner of the rise of the knowledge of its illusoriness
(mithyatva). If the person who sees the nacre-silver does not realize its
illusoriness throughout his life, he will continue to believe that it is real.
So the test to know whether a thing is real or mithya is whether the
sublating knowledge has arisen or not. There is another difference
between illusory silver and real silver. Bhrama is caused by ignorance.
Though real silver is also mithya, the cause of its appearance is
ignorance of Brahman and the substratum (adhishthana) is Brahman
itself. For the illusory silver appearing on nacre the cause is ignorance of
Brahman limited by nacre (sukti-avacchinna-Brahman) and the
substratum is Brahman limited by nacre. In both cases the bhrama will
cease only when the particular substratum is known.
So, from the empirical (vyaavahaarika) standpoint we describe a thing
as real when it has the unconditioned Brahman as its substratum and
we describe a thing as illusory when is has Brahman limited by some
object (such as nacre in the case of silver) as its substratum. Thus there
are three levels of reality—paaramaarthika (absolute), vyaavahaarika
(empirical) and praatibhaasika (illusory).
</p>
                            <p>&#160;</p>
                            <p>Now the opponent raises an objection: If you say that the silver was
there during the period when the illusion lasted, then how can it be said
that it was never there during all the three periods of time? If, for
example, there is a book on the table now, and it is removed
subsequently, it cannot be said that it was never there in all the three
periods of time.
</p>
                            <p>Answer: The silver is not there as real silver in all the three periods of
time. It is never vyaavahaarika (empirically real) silver.
</p>
                            <p>Opponent: You did not see real silver. You saw only illusory silver. So
what you should say is that illusory silver is not there in all the periods
of time. But what you are denying is the existence of real silver. That
means that you saw one thing and you are denying the existence of
another thing.</p>
                            <p>
Answer: If there is a book on the table, there is the relationship of
contact between the book and the table, but there is no relationship such
as samavaaya (inherence) between the book and the table. So even when
there is a relationship of one kind, there can at the same time be absence
of relationship of another kind. Only a relationship of the same kind
cannot be asserted and denied at the same time, and not relationships of
two different kinds. Similarly here there is absence of real silver at the
same time as there is presence of illusory (or false) silver.
</p>
                            <p>Question: A person who has seen the illusory silver says subsequently,
on knowing that there is only nacre, that there was no silver at all there .
Nobody says that silver was there and has gone subsequently. So it
cannot be said that he experienced indescribable (anirvaachya) silver
earlier.
</p>
                            <p>Answer: Sublation (baadhaa) is of two kinds. (1) Both the silver and its
cause, ignorance, are removed. (2) The silver is known to be false, but the
ignorance has not gone. The second kind of sublation occurs when a
reliable person comes and says that there is no silver there. In this case,
the ignorance which made the silver appear is not removed, but the silver
is known to be false. However, the object in front continues to look like
silver, but the person believes the word of the reliable person that it is
not silver. The first kind of sublation happens when the person who saw
the silver realizes that the object in front is only nacre. In this case the
ignorance of nacre, which was the cause of the appearance of silver, is
also destroyed. In such a sublation he cannot at all think that there was
silver previously.
The knowledge of the substratum, nacre, destroys even the samskara
of the illusion. So even the remembrance that silver was seen in the
illusion disappears because the cause of such remembrance, namely, the
samskara, is no longer there. But he will remember that he had such an
illusion, though he will not remember that he saw silver there. The
samskara for remembering “I saw silver” and the samskara for
remembering “I had an illusion that I saw silver” are different. While the
former samskara is destroyed by the knowledge of the substratum, the
latter is not destroyed. So there is only remembrance of the knowledge of
the illusion and not remembrance of silver. Remembrance of an object
and remembrance of knowledge are different. So he cannot remember the
silver, but he can remember the knowledge of the illusion. There can
therefore be no valid objection to the statement that there was silver.
The suffix ‘vat’ indicates that the silver was indescribable as real or
unreal and that it was mithya.
There are four pramanas for this indescribability—pratyaksha,
anumana, arthapatti, and sruti.

Pratyaksha—by the statement “The silver I saw was false”, it follows
that a false silver was there. Thus there are two kinds of silver, real silver
and false silver.
Arthapatti- If it is said that false silver was also not seen, then it
could not have been seen as silver at all. But it was seen. Therefore false
silver was seen.
Sruti—The statement in the Veda, ”Then there was neither real nor
unreal; but there was tamas”. This statement means that tamas was
neither real nor unreal, but it was there. This proves that there can be
something which is not describable as real or unreal. Therefore the silver
seen is neither real nor unreal nor both, but it is different from both real
and unreal. This has been brought out by the suffix ‘vat’. Thus
‘anirvaachyatva’ (indescribability) is established.
Now another question is raised: The self is not an object according to
you (Advaitin). Adhyasa can happen only on an object such as nacre,
rope, etc. When a person sees nacre as silver he says, “This is silver” and
not “I am silver”. It therefore follows that there can be no adhyasa on the
self. The self is pure knowledge itself. It cannot become an object of
knowledge.
</p>
                            <p>The answer is: The self can be an object. It cannot be said that the self
cannot at all be an object, because it is the object of the concept ‘I”. In
this concept there are two parts: one is the internal organ (antahkarana),
and the other is the pure consciousness. If we leave out the internal
organ what is left is consciousness, which is the same as the self. So the
self is also an object of the concept ‘I’. The pure consciousness without
an upadhi is no doubt not an object of knowledge, but with the internal
organ as the upadhi it is an object.
Opponent: You say that the self with the upadhi of the internal organ
is an object. The self gets an upadhi only because of adhyasa. That
means that the self becomes an object only because of adhyasa and only
if it is an object there can be adhyasa on it. There is thus the defect of
mutual dependence.
The answer to this is: The adhyasa of the internal organ on the self is
beginningless. There is a continuous stream of adhyasa. It is like the
seed and the sprout. So the defect of mutual dependence does not come
in.
Moreover, the self need not be an object for adhyasa to take place.
Even without being an object it can be the substratum of adhyasa. In the
adhyasa of silver on nacre, what is necessary for adhyasa is that the
nacre should be cognized as ‘this’. If there is no such cognition there can
be no adhyasa. Nacre is not self-luminous and so it can be cognized only
by a mental modification (vritti). The self is self-luminous and so it does
not need another cognition to become known. The word ‘aparokshatvaat’
in the bhashya means that the self is directly perceived and is selfrevealing.
An object is first seen through the visual organ. That gives the
knowledge in the form, “There is this object”. Then the person says, “I see

this object”. It is only because the self shines in every cognition that a
person is able to say that he sees the object. This proves that the self
shines by itself.
Moreover, from the fact that ignorance is known, it is clear that the self
is self-luminous. Every one knows what he does not know. So every one
experiences his ignorance. This also proves that the self is self-luminous.
The Prabhakara school of Purvamimamsa does not accept the self to be
self-luminous. According to it, knowledge is self-luminous. In any
cognition the self who is the knower, the object known, and the
knowledge are simultaneously revealed. They say that ignorance is not
self-revealing. So, since ignorance is also known, they have necessarily to
admit that the self is self-luminous.
Now a question is raised by the opponent. What is meant by saying
that the self is ‘self-luminous’? Does it mean that the self illumines itself
and others, or does it mean something else? The Buddhists say that
knowledge becomes an object for the same knowledge. In knowledge of
pot both knowledge and pot are objects (vishaya). Objects are revealed by
light and light itself is revealed by the same light. This is not accepted by
Advaita. The vishaya or object of knowledge and the vishayi, the knower,
can never be the same. ‘Self-luminous’ means that it does not need any
other consciousness to reveal it, but it is not correct to say that it
illumines itself also. The self is always the knower and never the object.
Earlier, when it was said that the self is not absolutely a non-object
(avishaya), what was meant was that it could have objectiveness
attributed to it (aropita vishayatva) and not that it could be an object in
the true sense.
The conclusion is that the self is necessarily self-luminous and it need
not be an object for there to be adhyasa. Adhyasa of the non-self on the
self is therefore possible.
The opponent raises another objection. Adhyasa can take place only if
the thing on which there is superimposition is in front of the person who
experiences the illusion. Superimposition can occur only on an object
which is in front. The self is the person himself and so it cannot be in
front of him. There can therefore be no adhyasa on the self.
The answer is: There is no invariable rule that adhyasa can occur only
on an object in front. Akasa (ether) is not perceptible by the sense
organs. Still blueness is superimposed on it. The Tarkika says that akasa
is the abode of sound and so it is known only by inference. It is therefore
not perceptible as an object in front even according to the Tarkikas. In
spite of this, it is a well known fact that blueness is superimposed on
akasa. Similarly adhyasa is possible on the self though it cannot be
perceived as an object in front. By the use of the word ‘api’ after
‘apratyaksha’ in the bhashya the Acharya indicates that the view that
akasa is apratyaksha is not accepted by Advaita. According to Advaita
akasa is known directly by the witness-consciousness itself.
</p>
                            <p>
The Bhattas hold that akasa can be seen by the eye. This is rejected
by Advaita on the ground that, if akasa which has no form or colour can
be seen by the eye, it should also be possible to know it by the sense of
touch even though it does not have the quality of touch.
An objection is raised that, since one has to open the eyes to see akasa,
it is perceivable by the eyes.
The answer to this is that one has to open the eyes to see the blue
colour and not to see akasa. We can see with the eyes only things which
are limited in size and not what are unlimited, like akasa and the form of
Isvara. What we see with the eyes is not akasa but ‘avakasa’ or empty
space. If a thing can be seen by the eye, its absence should also be seen
by the eye. The rule is that the absence of a thing is known by the same
sense-organ by which its presence is known. So if we say that there is no
avakasa or empty space, it means that its absence is seen by the eye. So
a person has to open his eyes only to see that no object with form is
there and not to see empty space. Avakasa (empty space) is different from
akasa (ether). An empty space disappears when an object is put there,
but akasa remains unaffected. To know that a quality is or is not there,
we have to know its abode, for example to know smell we have to know
its abode, such as a flower. So when we say that there is no sound in a
particular place, we have to say that there is no sound in this particular
part of akasa. It is not necessary that the abode should be known by the
same organ by which its quality is known. Smell is known by the
olfactory organ, but the flower is known by the eye. We know sound by
the ear, but its abode, akasa, need not be known by the ear. It is known
by the witness-consciousness.
</p>
                            <p>All the objections raised against the possibility of superimposition of
the not-self on the self have been refuted in the preceding lectures and
superimposition has been established.
Superimposition of the not-self on the self is the cause of such
notions as ‘I am a man’, ‘I am a doer and an enjoyer’, etc. The Acharya
says in the bhashya that the adhyasa of this nature is called avidya by
the learned. And the determination of the nature of the reality by
discrimination is called vidya . 
</p>
                            <p>It is only the superimposition of the not-self on the self that is called
avidya and not other superimpositions such as that of silver on nacre, or
snake on rope. It is only for getting rid of this avidya that the Sastra has
to be studied. In the Yogasutra avidya is defined as ‘looking upon the
not-self as the self’. So by the term ‘learned people’ those who are learned
in the Yogasastra are meant. This sentence should not be taken as
referring to ‘moola-avidya’ or as saying that there is no difference
between avidya and adhyasa. It only means that yogis refer to what we
call adhyasa as avidya. It is called avidya because it is destroyed by
vidya. According to Advaita, adhyasa can be called avidya because avidya
is the material cause of adhyasa, just as a pot made of clay can be called
clay. Eradicating this avidya is the main purpose of the Sastras. The
word <i>prahaanaaya</i> is used to show that adhyasa should be
destroyed along with its cause. <i>Moola-avidya</i> does not by itself do any
harm. It is adhyasa that is the cause of all evil. It can be got rid of only
by knowing the real self. The wrong identification will be removed only
when the substratum, the pure self, is realized. It is only the knowledge
arising from the mahavakyas that is called vidya. All other knowledge
falls under the category of avidya. The pure self is not at all affected by
avidya. It is not affected by the merits or defects of what is superimposed
on it by avidya.
</p>
                            <p>The mutual superimposition of the self and the not-self is the basis for
all activities in the world. Without this superimposition there can be no
activity. All the scriptures operate only with this superimposition as the
basis. Not only the karma kANDa but even the jnAna kANDa or vedAnta
is meant only for persons with this adhyAsa. This adhyAsa is necessary
for all the six valid means of knowledge (perception, inference,
comparison, verbal testimony, presumption, and non-apprehension).
A doubt arises. Superimposition is wrong knowledge (bhrAnti). If that
is the basis for the valid means of knowledge (pramANa), how can they be
accepted as valid? Even if such wrong knowledge is the basis for the
worldly means of knowledge, how can the SAstra have superimposition
as its basis? The object of the SAstra is to remove superimposition. So it
is contradictory to say that SAstra itself operates only because of
superimposition.
The answer to this is: In the world a person undertakes any action only
when the desire to acquire or get rid of some thing arises in him. Such a
desire arises only after he has got knowledge of the favourable or
unfavourable nature of that thing. So a person has first to become a
knower or pramAtA. Such a knower prompts his body to act in order to
fulfill his desire. The body is the instrument of the knower. The pure self
cannot be a knower. To become a knower and to perform action the
superimposition of the subtle and gross bodies is necessary. Knowership
and action are possible only for one who has the notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’
with regard to the sense-organs and the body. Unless he becomes a
knower his sense-organs cannot function. In deep sleep he has no
identification with the senses and the body and so he is not a knower.
Here the term ‘senses’ includes the mind also. In deep sleep there is no
identification with the mind. In the dream state there is superimposition
of the mind only. In dream the vAsanAs in his subtle body produce
various experiences for him. But these experiences are not caused or
prompted by him as a knower. So these are not the activities of the
senses. He can be called a knower only when he prompts the senses and
the body to action. In the waking state his consciousness is directed

outwards and so he is ‘bahishprajna’. In dream there is superimposition
of the subtle body alone. Only when the self is associated with the senses
there can be action.</p>
                            <p>		
Prakatarthakara raises another question. Soldiers fight a battle but
the victory or defeat is attributed to the king though the king does not
participate in the fighting. Similarly why cannot the senses function
without prompting by the self. The answer is that the king pays wages to
the soldiers and provides other amenities to them. He thus indirectly
prompts them to fight. So also, the self has to be associated with the
senses in order to make the senses function.
</p>
                            <p>Then another question arises. Superimposition of the senses alone is
sufficient. What is the need for the superimposition of the gross body
also? The answer to this is that the senses cannot function without the
gross body as adhishThAna or locus. The senses are part of the subtle
body, but they have corresponding physical organs in the gross body
such as the eyes, ear, nose, etc. These are called ‘golaka’. Without these
the senses cannot function. When the subtle body departs from the gross
body on death it is carried to other worlds by various devatas. The senseorgans
in the subtle body cannot then do any thing because they are no
longer located in the gross body. They can function only through the
golakas in the gross body. A person who has no identification with the
gross body cannot have such notions as ‘I am a knower, doer, enjoyer,
etc’. It is only when there is superimposition of the gross body on the
self that one can say ‘I am so and so’, etc. The self can become a knower
(pramAtA) only if there is identification with the subtle as well as the
gross bodies. Without the person becoming a knower the senses cannot
function. Knowledge of Brahman arises only to a person who is a
pramAtA, i.e., one who identifies himself with the two bodies. Not only
the karma kANDa but also the jnAna kANDa is only for one with the
superimposition of the two bodies. The object of moksha SAstra is to
destroy adhyAsa, but it can be studied and practised only by a person
who has identification with the two bodies.
</p>
                            <p>The Acharya further says that the behaviour of even the person who
has mastered Vedanta is not different from that of animals in the matter
of worldly dealings.
</p>
                            <p>Though he has acquired discrimination, it is only paroksha (indirect)
and it is obscured during worldly dealings. In deep sleep also there is no
difference between a learned man and one who is not learned.
When a cow sees a person coming towards it with a stick it infers that
he is coming to attack it and runs away. When a person comes with
grass in his hands it infers that the person comes to feed it and goes
towards him.</p>
                            <p>
Thus the animal uses both direct perception and inference to decide
what to do. In other words, it is also a knower (pramAtA) because of
adhyAsa. Thus there is similarity between even learned persons and
animals in the matter of worldly dealings.
</p>
                            <p>Now it may be asked: What has been said is true of worldly dealings.
But what about actions performed in accordance with the injunctions of
the Vedas? The answer is that adhyAsa of the bodies is necessary for
these also. A person performs a yajna for attaining heaven. For this he
must know that he has an AtmA different from the gross body, because
he knows that the gross body cannot go to heaven. But it is not
necessary for him to know that the AtmA is unattached, free from
hunger, thirst, etc and does not transmigrate, as stated in vedAnta. If he
has acquired this knowledge, then he will not do any karma for going to
heaven, etc. Moreover, he should identify himself as a Brahmana for
whom alone some of the rituals are prescribed. Thus adhyAsa is
necessary for a person to engage in any action including those prescribed
in the Vedas. Until a person realizes that he is the pure self, the SAstras
are applicable.
</p>
                            <p>It has been established that there is mutual superimposition between
the self which is pure consciousness, and the not-self consisting of the
body, mind and senses. Such a superimposition is essential for a jiva to
become a knower (pramaataa). Only if the jiva becomes a pramaataa he
can experience objects through the sense-organs. Only then he becomes
a seer, hearer, thinker, etc. Even for the Saastra to be applicable there
has to be superimposition. For performing the rituals laid down in the
Vedas for attaining heaven the person should know that there is a self
which is different from the gross body and which will continue after
death. But he need not know the real nature of the self as described in
Vedanta. If he knows the real nature of the self it will be an obstacle to
his performing the rituals laid down in the Vedas because there is
nothing to be attained by such a person. Rituals are laid down based on
caste such as Brahmana, etc., ashrama, age, etc. So a person has to
identify himself as a Brahmana or a grihasta, etc., to perform rituals. All
these relate to the body. Such identification is possible only if there is
adhyaasa of the body on the self.
</p>
                            <p>Superimposition has been defined in the bhashya as the cognition of
one thing as some thing else. Nacre is cognized as silver, rope as snake,
etc. The consequence of the mutual superimposition of the self and the
not-self is that when a person’s wife, son, etc., is happy he is also happy.
When they are unhappy he is also unhappy. He thus attributes to

himself the joys and sorrows of those near and dear to him. Similarly he
attributes to himself the qualities of his gross body such as stoutness,
etc., the qualities of his senses such as blindness, deafness, etc., and the
qualities of his mind such as thinking, deciding, etc. Wife, son etc., who
are external to the body are known as ‘gauna-atma’. The body, mind and
senses are known as ‘mithya-atma’.
</p>
                            <p>Here Prakatarthakara raises a question and answers it. A person sees
in himself the joys and sorrows of his wife, son etc. That means that he
sees what is somewhere else as present in himself. Does this not amount
to anyathakhyati? The answer is, no. What he sees is not what is
somewhere else, such as the good health or illness. It is another feeling
caused by his son’s condition. So it is not anyathakhyati.
</p>
                            <p>Can the attribution of the qualities of the body, mind and senses to
the self be said to be anyathakhyati? Here also the answer is, no. The
material cause of the body is not only the five elements but also the
nescience relating to the particular jiva. Since nescience is
anirvachaniyam, its effect, the body, is also the same. In this view maya
is the totality and individual nescience is a part of it. The body is not
something already existing elsewhere but it has come into existence from
the individual nescience. So anyathakhyati is not applicable.
</p>
                            <p>As stated above, the material cause of the body is the five elements
together with the nescience of the particular jiva. If we say that the
nescience alone is the material cause, then the body should disappear
when the nescience ceases, just as the illusory silver ceases to exist
when ignorance of the nacre is removed. The body merges in the
elements on death.
</p>
                            <p>Now another question arises. Since the nescience which is one of the
material causes of the body is still there on death, how can the body
merge in the elements? This is answered by taking the analogy of a cloth.
When all the threads are removed there will be no cloth though threads,
which are the material cause of cloth, still exist. So the effect can cease
to exist even if the cause is not destroyed. The effect, cloth, ceases to
exist because the conjunction (samyoga) of the threads, which is one of
the causes of the cloth, has ceased to exist.
</p>
                            <p>The qualities of the senses are also superimposed on the self. The
senses can function only when the corresponding organ in the body,
known as ‘golaka’ is in good condition. When the presiding deity
withdraws its blessing to the corresponding golaka, the particular sense
cannot function.
</p>
                            <p>The qualities of the mind such as thinking, etc., are also attributed to
the self.
</p>
                            <p>The entity referred to as ‘I’ is the blend of the self and the two bodies.
The witness of all its acts is the self.
</p>
                            <p>The difference between the body of a living being and a stone is
clearly seen. The former is sentient while the latter is inert. The sentiency

of the body is because of the superimposition of the self, which is pure
consciousness, on the body. There is a difference between this
superimposition and the superimposition of silver on nacre. In the latter
the silver alone is seen and the nacre is hidden, though it is seen as
‘this’, that is, some object in front. But in the case of the superimposition
of the self on the body, both the consciousness and the body are seen to
be present at the same time. There is mutual adhyaasa in both the
cases. In the case of nacre appearing as silver there is mutual
superimposition between the object in front which is cognized only as
‘this’ without the nacre-ness being known, and the silver. This is known
as ‘swaroopa-adhyaasa’. In the case of the superimposition of the self on
the body, the qualities of the self, namely, existence, luminosity, and
being loved (asti, bhaati, priyam) are attributed to the body and so the
body appears to exist, to be conscious and to be the object of love. The
other two qualities of the body, namely, name and form, belong to
maayaa. This superimposition of the self on the body is known as
‘samsarga-adhyaasa’, because only the qualities of the self are
superimposed.
</p>
                            <p>The existence of superimposition is proved by the theories held by
other schools also. The Charvakas consider the body to be the self. This
is only because of the superimposition of consciousness on the body. The
Buddhists consider the internal organ to be the self. This again means
that consciousness is superimposed on the internal organ. The
Naiyayikas say that what is referred to as ‘I’ is the self because of the
presence of consciousness. Thus mutual superimposition of the self and
the not-self is perceived all. This adhyaasa is also mithya. It is the cause
of the notion that the self is an agent and enjoyer. It is thus the cause of
all suffering. It has to be removed along with its cause, avidya, by
knowledge of the self. For removing the obstacles to the rise of selfknowledge
three means are laid down. These are hearing, reflection, and
meditation.
</p>
                            <p>Hearing is the determination, by the application of the six
characteristic signs, that the purport of the entire Vedanta is the nondual
Brahman. The six signs are—(1)the beginning and the conclusion,
(2)repetition, (3)originality, (4)result, (5)eulogy and (6)demonstration. The
Sanskrit terms for these are, respectively, upakramopasamhaara,
abhyaasa, apoorvataa, phala, arthavaada, upapatti. ‘Hearing’ removes
pramaana-asambhaavanaa, or the doubt about the pramaana or the
upanishad itself.
</p>
                            <p>Reflection is the constant thinking of Brahman, the One without a
second, already heard about from the teacher, by making use of
arguments in a constructive manner. ‘Reflection’ removes the doubt
whether Brahman and the jiva are identical or not. This doubt is called
prameya-asambhaavanaa.
Meditation is keeping the mind fixed on the thought of Brahman,
uninterrupted by any other thought. </p>
                            <p>Meditation is intended to remove

wrong notions such as “The universe is real; the difference between
Brahman and jiva is real”, which are contrary to the teachings of the
upanishads, by concentrating the mind on the self. By this anaatmavaasanaa
is removed and aatma-vaasanaa is established. Such wrong
notions are known as <i>viparita-bhaavanaa</i>.
</p>
                            <p>Thus the purpose of hearing, reflection and meditation is the removal
of obstacles in the form of doubts and wrong notions that stand in the
way of the dawn of Self-knowledge.
</p>
                            <p>For a person who does not have these obstructions mere upadesa of
the mahaavaakya by the Guru is sufficient. Others will need one or more
of these three steps, depending on the nature of the obstructions. If self-knowledge
does not come in this birth it will come in a future birth after
the obstructions are removed.
</p>
                            <p>The identity of jiva and Brahman is the subject-matter of all the
Upanishads. The purpose of the Upanishads is the total removal of the
mutual superimposition of the self and the not-self along with its cause.
